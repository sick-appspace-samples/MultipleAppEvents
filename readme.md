## MultipleAppEvents
Demonstrates how communication via events between two Apps can be setup.

### Description
This sample Apps show how event interfaces can be served and notified within one
App and handled asynchronously (non blocking) by another.
The 'ServeEventsApp' app serves an event and notifies it (served events/functions can be seen in the app Properties).
The 'UseEventsApp' app on the other hand is registering to that event and reacting when the event is being notified.

### How to Run
To demonstrate, both Apps must be started together.
The output can be seen on the console.
