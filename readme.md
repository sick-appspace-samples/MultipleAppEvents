## MultipleAppEvents
Communication via events between two Apps
### Description
This sample Apps show how event interfaces can be served and notified within one
App and handled asynchronously (non blocking) by another. One App serves an event and
notifies it, the other is registering to that event. And reacts when
the event is received.
### How to Run
To demonstrate, both Apps must be started together
